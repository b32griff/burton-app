      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>Caddie AI &nbsp;&middot;&nbsp; Last updated: February 17, 2026</p>
    </header>

    <p>Caddie AI ("the app", "we", "our") is an iOS golf swing coaching app developed by Burton Griffin (<span class="pill">com.burtongriffin.burton-app</span>). This policy explains what information the app collects, how it is used, and your choices.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

    <p><strong>Video frames and chat messages.</strong> When you record or upload a golf swing video for analysis, the app extracts key frames from the video and sends them to the Anthropic Claude API along with any accompanying chat messages. This is the core mechanism that powers the AI coaching feature.</p>

    <p><strong>Anonymous device identifier.</strong> The app uses RevenueCat to manage in-app subscriptions. RevenueCat assigns an anonymous identifier to your device to track subscription status. This identifier is not linked to your name, email address, or any other personal information.</p>

    <p><strong>App preferences and conversation history.</strong> Your coaching conversations, chat history, and app preferences (such as club selection) are stored locally on your device using Apple's UserDefaults. This data never leaves your device except as described below.</p>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Video frames and chat messages are sent to Anthropic's API solely to generate AI coaching responses. They are transmitted over an encrypted connection and are not stored permanently by this app on any server.</li>
      <li>The anonymous device identifier is used by RevenueCat to verify and restore your subscription. RevenueCat may process this identifier in accordance with their own privacy policy.</li>
      <li>Local on-device data is used only to display your conversation history and remember your preferences within the app.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>

    <p>We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties for advertising or marketing purposes.</p>

    <p>The only external services the app communicates with are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Anthropic</strong> – to process AI coaching requests. See <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anthropic's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>RevenueCat</strong> – to manage in-app subscriptions. See <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RevenueCat's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data We Do Not Collect</h2>

    <p>Caddie AI does not collect:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Your name, email address, or any account credentials</li>
      <li>Location data</li>
      <li>Contact list or calendar information</li>
      <li>Analytics or behavioral tracking data</li>
      <li>Advertising identifiers (IDFA)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The app contains no third-party analytics or tracking SDKs.</p>

    <h2>Video and Image Data</h2>

    <p>Video frames extracted for AI analysis are transmitted to Anthropic's API and are subject to Anthropic's data handling practices. The app does not retain copies of your video frames on any server operated by us. Your original videos remain on your device and are not uploaded in full.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>

    <p>Conversation history and preferences stored locally can be cleared at any time by deleting the app from your device. This removes all locally stored data. We do not maintain any server-side records tied to your identity that would require a separate deletion request.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>

    <p>Caddie AI is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided information through the app, please contact us and we will take appropriate steps.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>

    <p>All data transmitted to external APIs is sent over HTTPS (TLS-encrypted) connections. Data stored on-device is protected by iOS's built-in data protection mechanisms.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>

    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated "Last updated" date. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>

    <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy, please contact:</p>
